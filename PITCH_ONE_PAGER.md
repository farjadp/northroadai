## 🎯 The Problem

**90% of startups fail** — often due to avoidable mistakes in strategy, product, finance, legal, or sales.

Founders need expert guidance but can't afford to hire specialists:
- 💰 **$50,000+** to hire a founding team (CTO, CFO, lawyer, etc.)
- ⏰ **20+ hours/week** wasted searching for answers
- 🤷 **ChatGPT is too generic** — 73% of founders say they need specialized help
